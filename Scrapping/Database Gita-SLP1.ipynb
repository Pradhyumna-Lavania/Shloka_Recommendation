Tere are many impediments, especially in Tis age of hypocrisy, to practicing haWa-yoga, DyAna-yoga and jYAna-yoga, but Tere is no suC problem in executing karma-yoga or Bakti-yoga.\\nas long as Te material body exists, one has to meet Te demands of Te body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. but a person who is in pure Bakti-yoga, or in kfzRa consciousness, does not arouse Te senses while meeting Te demands of Te body. raTer, he accepts Te bare necessities of life, making Te best use of a bad bargEn, and enjoys transcendental happiness in kfzRa consciousness. he is callous toward incidental occurrences – suC as accidents, disease, scarcity and even Te deaT of a most dear relative – but he is always alert to execute his duties in kfzRa consciousness, or Bakti-yoga. accidents never deviate him from his duty. as stated in Te Bagavad-gItA (2.14), AgamApAyino ’nityAs tAṁs titikzasva BArata. he endures all suC incidental occurrences becOse he knows Tat Tey come and go and do not affect his duties. in Tis way he aCieves Te hiGest perfection in yoga practice.\\n]'],\n",

Tose really learned leaders of society like brahmA, Siva, kapila, Te kumAras, manu, vyAsa, devala, asita, janaka, prahlAda, bali, and later on maDvAcArya, rAmAnujAcArya, SrI cEtanya and many oTers – who are fETful PilosoPers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc. – surrender to Te lotus feet of Te supreme person, Te all-powerful OTority. Tose who are not actually PilosoPers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose Temselves as suC for material gEn, do not accept Te plan or paT of Te supreme lord. Tey have no idea of god; Tey simply manufacture Teir own worldly plans and consequently complicate Te problems of material existence in Teir vEn attempts to solve Tem. becOse material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist Te unOTorized plans of Te aTeists and baffle Te knowledge of “planning commissions.”\\nTe aTeistic planmakers are described herein by Te word duzkftinaH, or “miscreants.” kftI means one who has performed meritorious work. Te aTeist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, becOse any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. but becOse Te aTeist’s brEn is improperly utilized in opposing Te plan of Te supreme lord, Te aTeistic planmaker is called duzkftI, whiC indicates Tat his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.\\nin Te gItA it is clearly mentioned Tat material energy works fully under Te direction of Te supreme lord. it has no independent OTority. it works as Te shadow moves, in accordance wiT Te movements of Te object. but still material energy is very powerful, and Te aTeist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know Te plan of Te supreme lord. under illusion and Te modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in Te case of hiraRyakaSipu and rAvaRa, whose plans were smashed to dust alTouG Tey were boT materially learned as scientists, PilosoPers, administrators and educators.

Te lord helps suC devotees in various ways. as stated in Te vedas (kaWa upanizad 1.2.23), yam evEza vfRute tena laByas. tasyEza AtmA vivfRute tanuṁ svAm: one who is fully surrendered and engaged in Te devotional service of Te supreme lord can understand Te supreme lord as he is. and as stated in Bagavad-gItA (10.10), dadAmi budDi-yogaṁ tam: Te lord gives suC a devotee sufficient intelligence so Tat ultimately Te devotee can attEn him in his spiritual kingdom.\\nTe special qualification of Te pure devotee is Tat he is always Tinking of kfzRa wiTout deviation and wiTout considering Te time or place. Tere should be no impediments. he should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. some say Tat Te devotee should remEn in holy places like vfndAvana or some holy town where Te lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create Te atmosPere of vfndAvana by his devotional service. it was SrI advEta who told lord cEtanya, “Wherever you are, o lord – Tere is vfndAvana.”\\nas indicated by Te words satatam and nityaSaH, whiC mean “always,” “regularly,” or “every day,” a pure devotee constantly remembers kfzRa and meditates upon him. Tese are qualifications of Te pure devotee, for whom Te lord is most easily attEnable. Bakti-yoga is Te system Tat Te gItA recommends above all oTers. generally, Te Bakti-yogIs are engaged in five different ways: (1) SAnta-Bakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2) dAsya-Bakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) saKya-Bakta, engaged as friend; (4) vAtsalya-Bakta, engaged as parent; and (5) mADurya-Bakta, engaged as conjugal lover of Te supreme lord. in any of Tese ways, Te pure devotee is always constantly engaged in Te transcendental loving service of Te supreme lord and cannot forget Te supreme lord, and so for him Te lord is easily attEned. a pure devotee cannot forget Te supreme lord for a moment, and similarly Te supreme lord cannot forget his pure devotee for a moment. Tis is Te great blessing of Te kfzRa conscious process of Canting Te mahA-mantra – hare kfzRa, hare kfzRa, kfzRa kfzRa, hare hare. hare rAma, hare rAma, rAma rAma, hare hare.\\n]'],\n",

When one searCes for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee’s association one actually begins to study and understand Bagavad-gItA. by advancement in Te association of Te devotee one is placed in devotional service, and Tis service dispels all one’s misgivings about kfzRa, or god, and kfzRa’s activities, form, pastimes, name and oTer features. after Tese misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one’s study.

For instance, when Te seed of a particular tree is sown, Te tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. it is first a small, sprouting plant, Ten it assumes Te form of a tree, Ten it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is complete, Te flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown Te seed of Te tree. similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. Tere are different stages. Te sinful action may have already stopped wiTin Te individual, but Te results or Te fruit of Tat sinful action are still to be enjoyed. Tere are sins whiC are still in Te form of a seed, and Tere are oTers whiC are already fructified and are giving us fruit, whiC we are enjoying as distress and pEn.\\nas explEned in Te twenty-eiGT verse of Te sevenT Capter, a person who has completely ended Te reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from Te duality of Tis material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to Te supreme personality of goDead, kfzRa. in oTer words, Tose who are actually engaged in Te devotional service of Te supreme lord are already freed from all reactions. Tis statement is confirmed in Te padma purARa:\\naprArabDa-Palaṁ pApaṁkUwaṁ bIjaṁ PalonmuKamkrameREva pralIyetavizRu-Bakti-ratAtmanAm\\nFor Tose who are engaged in Te devotional service of Te supreme personality of goDead, all sinful reactions, wheTer fructified, in Te stock, or in Te form of a seed, gradually vanish. Terefore Te purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, Te purest. uttama means transcendental. tamas means Tis material world or darkness, and uttama means Tat whiC is transcendental to material activities. devotional activities are never to be considered material, alTouG sometimes it appears Tat devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. one who can see and is familiar wiT devotional service will know Tat Tey are not material activities. Tey are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by Te material modes of nature.\\nit is sEd Tat Te execution of devotional service is so perfect Tat one can perceive Te results directly. Tis direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience Tat any person who is Canting Te holy names of kfzRa (hare kfzRa, hare kfzRa, kfzRa kfzRa, hare hare. hare rAma, hare rAma, rAma rAma, hare hare) in course of Canting wiTout offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. Tis is actually seen. FurTermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast Te message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping Te missionary activities of kfzRa consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. Tis advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification. Te meTod itself is so pure Tat by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.\\nin Te vedAnta-sUtra (3.2.26) Tis is also described in Te following words: prakASaS ca karmaRy aByAsAt. “devotional service is so potent Tat simply by engaging in Te activities of devotional service one becomes enliGtened wiTout a doubt.” a practical example of Tis can be seen in Te previous life of nArada, who in Tat life happened to be Te son of a mEdservant. he had no education, nor was he born into a hiG family. but when his moTer was engaged in serving great devotees, nArada also became engaged, and sometimes, in Te absence of his moTer, he would serve Te great devotees himself. nArada personally says,\\nucCizwa-lepAn anumodito dvijEHsakft sma BuYje tad-apAsta-kilbizaHevaṁ pravfttasya viSudDa-cetasastad-Darma evAtma-ruciH prajAyate\\nin Tis verse from SrImad-BAgavatam (1.5.25) nArada describes his previous life to his disciple vyAsadeva. he says Tat while engaged as a boy servant for Tose purified devotees during Te four monTs of Teir stay, he was intimately associating wiT Tem. sometimes Tose sages left remnants of food on Teir dishes, and Te boy, who would wash Teir dishes, wanted to taste Te remnants. so he asked Te great devotees for Teir permission, and when Tey gave it nArada ate Tose remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. as he went on eating, he gradually became as pure-hearted as Te sages. Te great devotees relished Te taste of unceasing devotional service to Te lord by hearing and Canting, and nArada gradually developed Te same taste. nArada says furTer,\\ntatrAnv-ahaṁ kfzRa-kaTAH pragAyatAmanugraheRASfRavaṁ mano-harAHtAH SradDayA me ’nu-padaṁ viSfRvataHpriyaSravasy aNga mamABavad ruciH\\nby associating wiT Te sages, nArada got Te taste for hearing and Canting Te glories of Te lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service. Terefore, as described in Te vedAnta-sUtra, prakASaS ca karmaRy aByAsAt: if one is engaged simply in Te acts of devotional service, everyTing is revealed to him Otomatically, and he can understand. Tis is called pratyakza, directly perceived.\\nTe word Darmyam means “Te paT of religion.” nArada was actually a son of a mEdservant. he had no opportunity to go to sCool. he was simply assisting his moTer, and fortunately his moTer rendered some service to Te devotees. Te Cild nArada also got Te opportunity and simply by association aCieved Te hiGest goal of all religion. Te hiGest goal of all religion is devotional service, as stated in SrImad-BAgavatam (sa vE puṁsAṁ paro Darmo yato Baktir aDokzaje). religious people generally do not know Tat Te hiGest perfection of religion is Te attEnment of devotional service. as we have already discussed in regard to Te last verse of Capter eiGt (vedezu yajYezu tapaHsu cEva), generally vedic knowledge is required for self-realization. but here, alTouG nArada never went to Te sCool of Te spiritual master and was not educated in Te vedic principles, he acquired Te hiGest results of vedic study. Tis process is so potent Tat even wiTout performing Te religious process regularly, one can be rEsed to Te hiGest perfection. how is Tis possible? Tis is also confirmed in vedic literature: AcAryavAn puruzo veda. one who is in association wiT great AcAryas, even if he is not educated or has never studied Te vedas, can become familiar wiT all Te knowledge necessary for realization.\\nTe process of devotional service is a very happy one (su-suKam). Why? devotional service consists of SravaRaṁ kIrtanaṁ vizRoH, so one can simply hear Te Canting of Te glories of Te lord or can attend PilosoPical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by OTorized AcAryas. simply by sitting, one can learn; Ten one can eat Te remnants of Te food offered to god, nice palatable dishes. in every state devotional service is joyful. one can execute devotional service even in Te most poverty-stricken condition. Te lord says, patraṁ puzpaṁ Palaṁ toyam: he is ready to accept from Te devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, whiC are all avElable in every part of Te world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered wiT love. Tere are many instances in history. simply by tasting Te tulasI leaves offered to Te lotus feet of Te lord, great sages like sanat-kumAra became great devotees. Terefore Te devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. god accepts only Te love wiT whiC Tings are offered to him.\\nit is sEd here Tat Tis devotional service is eternally existing. it is not as Te mAyAvAdI PilosoPers clEm. alTouG Tey sometimes take to so-called devotional service, Teir idea is Tat as long as Tey are not liberated Tey will continue Teir devotional service, but at Te end, when Tey become liberated, Tey will “become one wiT god.” suC temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When Te devotee goes to Te spiritual planet in Te kingdom of god, he is also engaged Tere in serving Te supreme lord. he does not try to become one wiT Te supreme lord.\\nas will be seen in Bagavad-gItA, actual devotional service begins after liberation. after one is liberated, when one is situated in Te brahman position (brahma-BUta), one’s devotional service begins (samaH sarvezu BUtezu mad-Baktiṁ laBate parAm). no one can understand Te supreme personality of goDead by executing karma-yoga, jYAna-yoga, azwANga-yoga or any oTer yoga independently. by Tese yogic meTods one may make a little progress toward Bakti-yoga, but wiTout coming to Te stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is Te personality of goDead. in Te SrImad-BAgavatam it is also confirmed Tat when one becomes purified by executing Te process of devotional service, especially by hearing SrImad-BAgavatam or Bagavad-gItA from realized souls, Ten he can understand Te science of kfzRa, or Te science of god. evaṁ prasanna-manaso Bagavad-Bakti-yogataH. When one’s heart is cleared of all nonsense, Ten one can understand what god is. Tus Te process of devotional service, of kfzRa consciousness, is Te king of all education and Te king of all confidential knowledge. it is Te purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully wiTout difficulty. Terefore one should adopt it.\\n]'],\n",

Terefore i worship govinda, kfzRa, Te cOse of all cOses.” Terefore one should conclusively worship Te personal form of kfzRa as Te supreme personality of goDead who has eternal bliss and knowledge. he is Te source of all forms of vizRu, he is Te source of all forms of incarnation, and he is Te original supreme personality, as confirmed in Bagavad-gItA.\\nin Te vedic literature (gopAla-tApanI upanizad 1.1) Te following statement appears:\\nsac-cid-Ananda-rUpAyakfzRAyAklizwa-kAriRenamo vedAnta-vedyAyagurave budDi-sAkziRe\\n“i offer my respectful obeisances unto kfzRa, who has a transcendental form of bliss, eternity and knowledge. i offer my respect to him, becOse understanding him means understanding Te vedas, and he is Terefore Te supreme spiritual master.” Ten it is sEd, kfzRo vE paramaṁ dEvatam: “kfzRa is Te supreme personality of goDead.” (gopAla-tApanI upanizad 1.3) eko vaSI sarva-gaH kfzRa IqyaH: “Tat one kfzRa is Te supreme personality of goDead, and he is worshipable.” eko ’pi san bahuDA yo ’vaBAti: “kfzRa is one, but he is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.” (gopAla-tApanI upanizad 1.21)\\nTe brahma-saṁhitA (5.1) says,\\nISvaraH paramaH kfzRaHsac-cid-Ananda-vigrahaHanAdir Adir govindaHsarva-kAraRa-kAraRam\\n“Te supreme personality of goDead is kfzRa, who has a body of eternity, knowledge and bliss. he has no beginning, for he is Te beginning of everyTing. he is Te cOse of all cOses.”\\nelsewhere it is sEd, yatrAvatIrRaṁ kfzRAKyaṁ paraṁ brahma narAkfti: “Te supreme absolute truT is a person, his name is kfzRa, and he sometimes descends on Tis earT.” similarly, in Te SrImad-BAgavatam we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of Te supreme personality of goDead, and in Tis list Te name of kfzRa also appears. but Ten it is sEd Tat Tis kfzRa is not an incarnation of god but is Te original supreme personality of goDead himself (ete cAṁSa-kalAH puṁsaH kfzRas tu BagavAn svayam).\\nsimilarly, in Bagavad-gItA Te lord says, mattaH parataraṁ nAnyat: “Tere is noTing superior to my form as Te personality of goDead kfzRa.” he also says elsewhere in Bagavad-gItA, aham Adir hi devAnAm: “i am Te origin of all Te demigods.” and after understanding Bagavad-gItA from kfzRa, arjuna also confirms Tis in Te following words: paraṁ brahma paraṁ DAma pavitraṁ paramaṁ BavAn, “i now fully understand Tat you are Te supreme personality of goDead, Te absolute truT, and Tat you are Te refuge of everyTing.” Terefore Te universal form whiC kfzRa showed to arjuna is not Te original form of god. Te original is Te kfzRa form. Te universal form, wiT its Tousands and Tousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw Te attention of Tose who have no love for god. it is not god’s original form.\\nTe universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love wiT Te lord in different transcendental relationships. Te supreme goDead exCanges transcendental love in his original form of kfzRa. Terefore to arjuna, who was so intimately related wiT kfzRa in friendship, Tis form of Te universal manifestation was not pleasing; raTer, it was fearful. arjuna, who was a constant companion of kfzRa’s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Terefore he was not captivated by Te universal form. Tis form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating Temselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service Te two-handed form of kfzRa is Te most dear.\\n]'],\n",

       "              '[\\n\\nkfzRa has now explEned about Te personal, Te impersonal and Te universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogIs. generally, Te transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. one is Te impersonalist, and Te oTer is Te personalist. Te personalist devotee engages himself wiT all energy in Te service of Te supreme lord. Te impersonalist also engages himself, not directly in Te service of kfzRa but in meditation on Te impersonal brahman, Te unmanifested.\\nWe find in Tis Capter Tat of Te different processes for realization of Te absolute truT, Bakti-yoga, devotional service, is Te hiGest. if one at all desires to have Te association of Te supreme personality of goDead, Ten he must take to devotional service.\\nTose who worship Te supreme lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Tose who engage Temselves in meditation on Te impersonal brahman are called impersonalists. arjuna is here questioning whiC position is better. Tere are different ways to realize Te absolute truT, but kfzRa indicates in Tis Capter Tat Bakti-yoga, or devotional service to him, is Te hiGest of all. it is Te most direct, and it is Te easiest means for association wiT Te goDead.\\nin Te second Capter of Bagavad-gItA, Te supreme lord explEned Tat a living entity is not Te material body; he is a spiritual spark. and Te absolute truT is Te spiritual whole. in Te sevenT Capter he spoke of Te living entity as being part and parcel of Te supreme whole and recommended Tat he transfer his attention fully to Te whole. Ten agEn in Te eiGT Capter it was sEd Tat anyone who Tinks of kfzRa at Te time of quitting his body is at once transferred to Te spiritual sky, to Te abode of kfzRa. and at Te end of Te sixT Capter Te lord clearly sEd Tat of all yogIs, one who always Tinks of kfzRa wiTin himself is considered Te most perfect. so in practically every Capter Te conclusion has been Tat one should be attaCed to Te personal form of kfzRa, for Tat is Te hiGest spiritual realization.\\nneverTeless, Tere are Tose who are not attaCed to Te personal form of kfzRa. Tey are so firmly detaCed Tat even in Te preparation of commentaries to Bagavad-gItA Tey want to distract oTer people from kfzRa and transfer all devotion to Te impersonal brahma-jyotir. Tey prefer to meditate on Te impersonal form of Te absolute truT, whiC is beyond Te reaC of Te senses and is not manifest.\\nand so, factually, Tere are two classes of transcendentalists. now arjuna is trying to settle Te question of whiC process is easier and whiC of Te classes is most perfect. in oTer words, he is clarifying his own position becOse he is attaCed to Te personal form of kfzRa. he is not attaCed to Te impersonal brahman. he wants to know wheTer his position is secure. Te impersonal manifestation, eiTer in Tis material world or in Te spiritual world of Te supreme lord, is a problem for meditation. actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of Te impersonal feature of Te absolute truT. Terefore arjuna wants to say, “What is Te use of suC a waste of time?” arjuna experienced in Te elevenT Capter Tat to be attaCed to Te personal form of kfzRa is best becOse he could Tus understand all oTer forms at Te same time and Tere was no disturbance to his love for kfzRa.

Tat will control Te eyes. similarly, Te ears should be engaged in hearing about kfzRa and Te nose in smelling Te flowers offered to kfzRa. Tis is Te process of devotional service, and it is understood here Tat Bagavad-gItA is simply expounding Te science of devotional service. devotional service is Te mEn and sole objective. unintelligent commentators on Te Bagavad-gItA try to divert Te mind of Te reader to oTer subjects, but Tere is no oTer subject in Bagavad-gItA Tan devotional service.\\nFalse ego means accepting Tis body as oneself. When one understands Tat he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. ego is Tere. False ego is condemned, but not real ego. in Te vedic literature (bfhad-AraRyaka upanizad 1.4.10) it is sEd, ahaṁ brahmAsmi: i am brahman, i am spirit. Tis “i am,” Te sense of self, also exists in Te liberated stage of self-realization. Tis sense of “i am” is ego, but when Te sense of “i am” is applied to Tis false body it is false ego. When Te sense of self is applied to reality, Tat is real ego. Tere are some PilosoPers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego, becOse ego means identity. We ouGt, of course, to give up Te false identification wiT Te body.\\none should try to understand Te distress of accepting birT, deaT, old age and disease. Tere are descriptions in various vedic literatures of birT. in Te SrImad-BAgavatam Te world of Te unborn, Te Cild’s stay in Te womb of Te moTer, its suffering, etc., are all very graPically described. it should be TorouGly understood Tat birT is distressful. becOse we forget how muC distress we have suffered wiTin Te womb of Te moTer, we do not make any solution to Te repetition of birT and deaT. similarly at Te time of deaT Tere are all kinds of sufferings, and Tey are also mentioned in Te OToritative scriptures. Tese should be discussed. and as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. no one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but Tere is no avoiding Tese. unless we have a pessimistic view of Tis material life, considering Te distresses of birT, deaT, old age and disease, Tere is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life.\\nas for detaCment from Cildren, wife and home, it is not meant Tat one should have no feeling for Tese. Tey are natural objects of affection. but when Tey are not favorable to spiritual progress, Ten one should not be attaCed to Tem. Te best process for making Te home pleasant is kfzRa consciousness. if one is in full kfzRa consciousness, he can make his home very happy, becOse Tis process of kfzRa consciousness is very easy. one need only Cant hare kfzRa, hare kfzRa, kfzRa kfzRa, hare hare. hare rAma, hare rAma, rAma rAma, hare hare, accept Te remnants of foodstuffs offered to kfzRa, have some discussion on books like Bagavad-gItA and SrImad-BAgavatam, and engage oneself in deity worship. Tese four Tings will make one happy. one should trEn Te members of his family in Tis way. Te family members can sit down morning and evening and Cant togeTer hare kfzRa, hare kfzRa, kfzRa kfzRa, hare hare. hare rAma, hare rAma, rAma rAma, hare hare. if one can mold his family life in Tis way to develop kfzRa consciousness, following Tese four principles, Ten Tere is no need to Cange from family life to renounced life. but if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, Ten family life should be abandoned. one must sacrifice everyTing to realize or serve kfzRa, just as arjuna did. arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood Tat Tese family members were impediments to his kfzRa realization, he accepted Te instruction of kfzRa and fouGt and killed Tem. in all cases, one should be detaCed from Te happiness and distress of family life, becOse in Tis world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\\nhappiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. one should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bagavad-gItA. one can never restrict Te coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detaCed from Te materialistic way of life and be Otomatically equipoised in boT cases. generally, when we get someTing desirable we are very happy, and when we get someTing undesirable we are distressed. but if we are actually in Te spiritual position Tese Tings will not agitate us. to reaC Tat stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service. devotional service to kfzRa wiTout deviation means engaging oneself in Te nine processes of devotional service – Canting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc. – as described in Te last verse of Te ninT Capter. Tat process should be followed.\\nnaturally, when one is adapted to Te spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix wiT materialistic men. Tat would go agEnst his grEn. one may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, wiTout unwanted association. naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, becOse he understands Tat Tese are simply a waste of time. Tere are many researC sColars and PilosoPers who study sex life or some oTer subject, but according to Bagavad-gItA suC researC work and PilosoPical speculation have no value. Tat is more or less nonsensical. according to Bagavad-gItA, one should make researC, by PilosoPical discretion, into Te nature of Te soul. one should make researC to understand Te self. Tat is recommended here.\\nas far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here Tat Bakti-yoga is especially practical. as soon as Tere is a question of devotion, one must consider Te relationship between Te supersoul and Te individual soul. Te individual soul and Te supersoul cannot be one, at least not in Te Bakti conception, Te devotional conception of life. Tis service of Te individual soul to Te supreme soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. so Bakti, or devotional service, is eternal. one should be established in Tat PilosoPical conviction.\\nin Te SrImad-BAgavatam (1.2.11) Tis is explEned. vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jYAnam advayam. “Tose who are actually knowers of Te absolute truT know Tat Te self is realized in Tree different Pases, as brahman, paramAtmA and BagavAn.” BagavAn is Te last word in Te realization of Te absolute truT; Terefore one should reaC up to Tat platform of understanding Te supreme personality of goDead and Tus engage in Te devotional service of Te lord. Tat is Te perfection of knowledge.\\nbeginning from practicing humility up to Te point of realization of Te supreme truT, Te absolute personality of goDead, Tis process is just like a stErcase beginning from Te ground floor and going up to Te top floor. now on Tis stErcase Tere are so many people who have reaCed Te first floor, Te second or Te Tird floor, etc., but unless one reaCes Te top floor, whiC is Te understanding of kfzRa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. if anyone wants to compete wiT god and at Te same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. it is clearly stated Tat wiTout humility, understanding is not truly possible. to Tink oneself god is most puffed up. alTouG Te living entity is always being kicked by Te stringent laws of material nature, he still Tinks, “i am god” becOse of ignorance. Te beginning of knowledge, Terefore, is amAnitva, humility. one should be humble and know Tat he is subordinate to Te supreme lord. due to rebellion agEnst Te supreme lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. one must know and be convinced of Tis truT.\\n]'],\n",

Tere may be a little so-called mental happiness – “i have Tis house or Tis money” – but Tis is not actual happiness.\\nas far as Te mode of ignorance is concerned, Te performer is wiTout knowledge, and Terefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. animal life is always miserable, alTouG, under Te spell of Te illusory energy, mAyA, Te animals do not understand Tis. slOGtering poor animals is also due to Te mode of ignorance. Te animal killers do not know Tat in Te future Te animal will have a body suitable to kill Tem. Tat is Te law of nature. in human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. Tat is Te law of Te state. becOse of ignorance, people do not perceive Tat Tere is a complete state controlled by Te supreme lord. every living creature is a son of Te supreme lord, and he does not tolerate even an ant’s being killed. one has to pay for it. so indulgence in animal killing for Te taste of Te tongue is Te grossest kind of ignorance. a human being has no need to kill animals, becOse god has supplied so many nice Tings. if one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood Tat he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. of all kinds of animal killing, Te killing of cows is most vicious becOse Te cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. cow slOGter is an act of Te grossest type of ignorance. in Te vedic literature (Ṛg veda 9.46.4) Te words goBiH prIRita-matsaram indicate Tat one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing Te cow is in Te grossest ignorance. Tere is also a prayer in Te vedic literature Tat states:\\nnamo brahmaRya-devAyago-brAhmaRa-hitAya cajagad-DitAya kfzRAyagovindAya namo namaH\\n“my lord, you are Te well-wisher of Te cows and Te brAhmaRas, and you are Te well-wisher of Te entire human society and world.” (vizRu purARa 1.19.65) Te purport is Tat special mention is given in Tat prayer for Te protection of Te cows and Te brAhmaRas. brAhmaRas are Te symbol of spiritual education, and cows are Te symbol of Te most valuable food; Tese two living creatures, Te brAhmaRas and Te cows, must be given all protection – Tat is real advancement of civilization. in modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. it is to be understood, Ten, Tat human society is advancing in Te wrong direction and is clearing Te paT to its own condemnation. a civilization whiC guides Te citizens to become animals in Teir next lives is certEnly not a human civilization. Te present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by Te modes of passion and ignorance. it is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide Te easiest process, kfzRa consciousness, to save humanity from Te greatest danger.\\n]'],\n",

For a <em>sannyAsI,</em> intimate relations wiT women and possession of wealT for sense gratification are strictly forbidden.

       "              '[\\n\\nin Te beginning of Te FifteenT Capter, Te banyan tree of Tis material world was explEned. Te extra roots coming out of it were compared to Te activities of Te living entities, some Ospicious, some inOspicious. in Te ninT Capter, also, Te devas, or godly, and Te asuras, Te ungodly, or demons, were explEned. now, according to vedic rites, activities in Te mode of goodness are considered Ospicious for progress on Te paT of liberation, and suC activities are known as dEvI prakfti, transcendental by nature. Tose who are situated in Te transcendental nature make progress on Te paT of liberation. For Tose who are acting in Te modes of passion and ignorance, on Te oTer hand, Tere is no possibility of liberation. eiTer Tey will have to remEn in Tis material world as human beings, or Tey will descend among Te species of animals or even lower life forms. in Tis sixteenT Capter Te lord explEns boT Te transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and Te demoniac nature and its qualities. he also explEns Te advantages and disadvantages of Tese qualities.\\nTe word aBijAtasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. to beget a Cild in a godly atmosPere is known in Te vedic scriptures as garBADAna-saṁskAra. if Te parents want a Cild in Te godly qualities Tey should follow Te ten principles recommended for Te social life of Te human being. in Bagavad-gItA we have studied also before Tat sex life for begetting a good Cild is kfzRa himself. sex life is not condemned, provided Te process is used in kfzRa consciousness. Tose who are in kfzRa consciousness at least should not beget Cildren like cats and dogs but should beget Tem so Tat Tey may become kfzRa conscious after birT. Tat should be Te advantage of Cildren born of a faTer and moTer absorbed in kfzRa consciousness.\\nTe social institution known as varRASrama-Darma – Te institution dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational divisions or castes – is not meant to divide human society according to birT. suC divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. Tey are to keep Te society in a state of peace and prosperity. Te qualities mentioned herein are explEned as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so Tat he can get liberated from Te material world.\\nin Te varRASrama institution Te sannyAsI, or Te person in Te renounced order of life, is considered to be Te head or Te spiritual master of all Te social statuses and orders. a brAhmaRa is considered to be Te spiritual master of Te Tree oTer sections of a society, namely, Te kzatriyas, Te vESyas and Te SUdras, but a sannyAsI, who is on Te top of Te institution, is considered to be Te spiritual master of Te brAhmaRas also. For a sannyAsI, Te first qualification should be fearlessness. becOse a sannyAsI has to be alone wiTout any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on Te mercy of Te supreme personality of goDead. if one Tinks, “after i leave my connections, who will protect me?” he should not accept Te renounced order of life. one must be fully convinced Tat kfzRa or Te supreme personality of goDead in his localized aspect as paramAtmA is always wiTin, Tat he is seeing everyTing, and he always knows what one intends to do. one must Tus have firm conviction Tat kfzRa as paramAtmA will take care of a soul surrendered to him. “i shall never be alone,” one should Tink. “even if i live in Te darkest regions of a forest i shall be accompanied by kfzRa, and he will give me all protection.” Tat conviction is called aBayam, fearlessness. Tis state of mind is necessary for a person in Te renounced order of life.\\nTen he has to purify his existence. Tere are so many rules and regulations to be followed in Te renounced order of life. most important of all, a sannyAsI is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship wiT a woman. he is even forbidden to talk wiT a woman in a secluded place. lord cEtanya was an ideal sannyAsI, and when he was at purI his feminine devotees could not even come near to offer Teir respects. Tey were advised to bow down from a distant place. Tis is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on Te sannyAsI not to have close connections wiT women. one has to follow Te rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyAsI, intimate relations wiT women and possession of wealT for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. Te ideal sannyAsI was lord cEtanya himself, and we can learn from his life Tat he was very strict in regards to women. alTouG he is considered to be Te most liberal incarnation of goDead, accepting Te most fallen conditioned souls, he strictly followed Te rules and regulations of Te sannyAsa order of life in connection wiT association wiT women. one of his personal associates, namely Cowa haridAsa, was associated wiT lord cEtanya along wiT his oTer confidential personal associates, but somehow or oTer Tis Cowa haridAsa looked lustily on a young woman, and lord cEtanya was so strict Tat he at once rejected him from Te society of his personal associates. lord cEtanya sEd, “For a sannyAsI or anyone who is aspiring to get out of Te clutCes of material nature and trying to elevate himself to Te spiritual nature and go back home, back to goDead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification – not even enjoying Tem, but just looking toward Tem wiT suC a propensity – is so condemned Tat he had better commit suicide before experiencing suC illicit desires.” so Tese are Te processes for purification.\\n Te next item is jYAna-yoga-vyavasTiti: being engaged in Te cultivation of knowledge. sannyAsI life is meant for distributing knowledge to Te householders and oTers who have forgotten Teir real life of spiritual advancement. a sannyAsI is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but Tis does not mean Tat he is a beggar. humility is also one of Te qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility Te sannyAsI goes from door to door, not exactly for Te purpose of begging, but to see Te householders and awaken Tem to kfzRa consciousness. Tis is Te duty of a sannyAsI. if he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preaC kfzRa consciousness wiT logic and understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept Te renounced order of life. but even if one has accepted Te renounced order of life wiTout sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. a sannyAsI, or one in Te renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saṁSudDi (purity) and jYAna-yoga (knowledge).\\nTe next item is Carity. Carity is meant for Te householders. Te householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of Teir income to propagate kfzRa consciousness all over Te world. Tus a householder should give in Carity to institutional societies Tat are engaged in Tat way. Carity should be given to Te riGt receiver. Tere are different kinds of Carity, as will be explEned later on – Carity in Te modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Carity in Te mode of goodness is recommended by Te scriptures, but Carity in Te modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, becOse it is simply a waste of money. Carity should be given only to propagate kfzRa consciousness all over Te world. Tat is Carity in Te mode of goodness.\\nTen as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for oTer orders of religious society, but is especially meant for Te householder. alTouG he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. Tere are restrictions for Te householders even in sex life, whiC should only be engaged in for Te propagation of Cildren. if he does not require Cildren, he should not enjoy sex life wiT his wife. modern society enjoys sex life wiT contraceptive meTods or more abominable meTods to avoid Te responsibility of Cildren. Tis is not in Te transcendental quality, but is demoniac. if anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a Cild wiTout Te purpose of serving kfzRa. if he is able to beget Cildren who will be in kfzRa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of Cildren, but wiTout Tis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\\nsacrifice is anoTer item to be performed by Te householders, becOse sacrifices require a large amount of money. Tose in oTer orders of life, namely brahmacarya, vAnaprasTa and sannyAsa, have no money; Tey live by begging. so performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for Te householders. Tey should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in Te vedic literature, but suC sacrifices at Te present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform Tem. Te best sacrifice recommended in Tis age is called saNkIrtana-yajYa. Tis saNkIrtana-yajYa, Te Canting of hare kfzRa, hare kfzRa, kfzRa kfzRa, hare hare. hare rAma, hare rAma, rAma rAma, hare hare, is Te best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. so Tese Tree items, namely Carity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for Te householder.\\nTen svADyAya, vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life. brahmacArIs should have no connection wiT women; Tey should live a life of celibacy and engage Te mind in Te study of vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. Tis is called svADyAya.\\ntapas, or Osterity, is especially meant for Te retired life. one should not remEn a householder TrouGout his whole life; he must always remember Tat Tere are four divisions of life – brahmacarya, gfhasTa, vAnaprasTa and sannyAsa. so after gfhasTa, householder life, one should retire. if one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in Te renounced order of life. Tese are Te regulations of Te vedic religious discipline. a man retired from household life must practice Osterities of Te body, mind and tongue. Tat is tapasya. Te entire varRASrama-Darma society is meant for tapasya. WiTout tapasya, or Osterity, no human being can get liberation. Te Teory Tat Tere is no need of Osterity in life, Tat one can go on speculating and everyTing will be nice, is recommended neiTer in Te vedic literature nor in Bagavad-gItA. suC Teories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gaTer more followers. if Tere are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Terefore Tose who want followers in Te name of religion, just to have a show only, don’t restrict Te lives of Teir students, nor Teir own lives. but Tat meTod is not approved by Te vedas.\\nas far as Te brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow Tis principle, but every member, be he in Te brahmacArI ASrama, gfhasTa ASrama, vAnaprasTa ASrama or sannyAsa ASrama. one should be very simple and strEGtforward.\\nahiṁsA means not arresting Te progressive life of any living entity. one should not Tink Tat since Te spirit spark is never killed even after Te killing of Te body Tere is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. people are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grEns, fruits and milk. Tere is no necessity for animal killing. Tis injunction is for everyone.

Tis is called ahiṁsA.\\nsatyam. Tis word means Tat one should not distort Te truT for some personal interest. in vedic literature Tere are some difficult passages, but Te meaning or Te purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. Tat is Te process for understanding Te vedas. Sruti means Tat one should hear from Te OTority. one should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. Tere are so many commentaries on Bagavad-gItA Tat misinterpret Te original text. Te real import of Te word should be presented, and Tat should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\\nakroDa means to Ceck anger. even if Tere is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. anger is a product of Te mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should Ceck himself from anger. apESunam means Tat one should not find fOlt wiT oTers or correct Tem unnecessarily. of course to call a Tief a Tief is not fOltfinding, but to call an honest person a Tief is very muC offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. hrI means Tat one should be very modest and must not perform some act whiC is abominable. acApalam, determination, means Tat one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. Tere may be fElure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for Tat; he should make progress wiT patience and determination.\\nTe word tejas used here is meant for Te kzatriyas. Te kzatriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to Te weak. Tey should not pose Temselves as nonviolent. if violence is required, Tey must exhibit it. but a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certEn conditions show forgiveness. he may excuse minor offenses.\\nSOcam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings also. it is especially meant for Te mercantile people, who should not deal in Te black market. nAti-mAnitA, not expecting honor, applies to Te SUdras, Te worker class, whiC are considered, according to vedic injunctions, to be Te lowest of Te four classes. Tey should not be puffed up wiT unnecessary prestige or honor and should remEn in Teir own status. it is Te duty of Te SUdras to offer respect to Te hiGer class for Te upkeep of Te social order.\\nall Tese twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.

For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one wiT Te tree but to enjoy Te fruits of Te tree. impersonalists generally give Te example of a river flowing into Te ocean and merging. Tis may be a source of happiness for Te impersonalist, but Te personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in Te ocean. We find so many living entities wiTin Te ocean, if we go deep. surface acquEntance wiT Te ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of Te aquatics living in Te ocean depTs.\\nbecOse of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand Te transcendental qualities and Te opulences of Te supreme lord in truT. as it is stated in Te elevenT Capter, only by devotional service can one understand. Te same is confirmed here; one can understand Te supreme personality of goDead by devotional service and enter into his kingdom.\\nafter attEnment of Te brahma-BUta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one’s hearing about Te lord. When one hears about Te supreme lord, Otomatically Te brahma-BUta stage develops, and material contamination – greediness and lust for sense enjoyment – disappears. as lust and desires disappear from Te heart of a devotee, he becomes more attaCed to Te service of Te lord, and by suC attaCment he becomes free from material contamination. in Tat state of life he can understand Te supreme lord.
