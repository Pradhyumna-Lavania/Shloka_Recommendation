Tis is known as yogamAyA. it carries a twofold notion, namely, transcendental notion and mundane inert notion. kfzRa himself, his subjective portions and Tose jIvas who are his unalloyed separated particles, realize Te transcendental notion in Tat conjunction, while conditioned souls feel Te mundane inert notion. Te external coating of transcendental knowledge in Te conscious activities of conditioned souls, bears Te name of yoganidrA. Tis is also an influence of Te cit potency of Te divinity.

<div class=""rich-text""><div class=""r r-lang-en r-paragraph"" id=""bb1582768""><p>let us pOse to consider what Te absolute reality is in himself.

<div class=""rich-text""><div class=""r r-lang-en r-paragraph"" id=""bb1582769""><p>by Te explanation <em>taTApi... vraja-vanitAnAm,</em> SrIla jIva gosvAmI has expressed his profound implication. joyous pastimes by Te medium of seeming error, <em>viBrama-vilAsa,</em> as Te contrivance of yogamAyA, has also been admitted in Te concluding statements of rUpa and sanAtana. still, since SrIpAda jIva gosvAmI has established Te identity of goloka wiT gokula, it must be admitted Tat Tere is transcendental reality underlying all Te pastimes of gokula. a husband is one who binds oneself in wedlock wiT a girl, while a paramour is one who, in order to win anoTer's wife's love by means of love, crosses Te conventions of morality, by Te impulse of Te sentiment Tat regards her love as Te be-all and end-all of existence. in goloka Tere is no suC function at all as Tat of Te nuptial relationship. hence Tere is no husbanDood Caracterized by suC connection. on Te oTer hand since Te <em>gopIs,</em> who are self-supported real entities are not tied to anybody else in wedlock, Tey cannot also have Te state of concubinage. Tere can also be no separate entities in Te forms of <em>svakIya</em> (conjugal) and <em>parakIya</em> (adulterous) states. in Te visible pastimes on Te mundane plane Te function in Te form of Te nuptial relationship is found to exist. kfzRa is beyond Te scope of Tat function. hence Te sEd function of Te circle of all-love is contrived by yogamAyA. kfzRa tastes Te transcendental <em>rasa</em> akin to paramourship by overstepping Tat function. Tis pastime of going beyond Te pale of Te apparent moral function manifested by yogamAyA, is, however, also observable only on Te mundane plane by Te eye Tat is enwrapped by Te mundane covering; but Tere is really no suC levity in Te pastimes of kfzRa. Te <em>rasa</em> of paramourship is certEnly Te extracted essence of all Te <em>rasas.</em> if it be sEd Tat it does not exist in goloka, it would be hiGly deprecatory to goloka. it is not Te fact Tat Tere is no supremely wholesome tasting of <em>rasa</em> in Te supremely excellent realm of goloka. kfzRa, Te fountEnhead of all <em>avatAras.</em> tastes Te same in a distinct form in goloka and in anoTer distinct form in gokula. Terefore, in spite of Te seeming appearance, to Te mundane eye, of outstepping Te bounds of Te legitimate function by Te form of paramourship, Tere must be present Te truT of it in some form even in <em>goloka.

<div class=""rich-text""><div class=""r r-lang-en r-paragraph"" id=""bb1582770""><p>agEn suC is Te nature of Te principle of Te majesty Tat in Te realm of vEkuRWa Tere is no <em>rasa</em> of parental affection towards Te source of all <em>avatAras.</em> but in goloka, Te seat of all superexcellent deliciousness, Tere is no more Tan Te original sentimental egoistic assumption of Te same <em>rasa.</em> Tere nanda and yaSodA are visibly present, but Tere is no occurrence of birT.

Te divine <em>rasa</em> is lovely wiT Te variegatedness of Te fourfold distinction of <em>viBAva, anuBAva, sAttvika</em> and <em>vyaBicAri</em> and Te <em>rasa</em> is ever present in goloka and vEkuRWa.

all Tese arts manifesting Teir own eternal forms are ever visible in Te region of goloka as Te ingredients of rasa; and, in Te mundane sPere, Tey have been unstintedly exhibited in Te pastimes of vraja by Te spiritual (cit) potency. yogamAyA. so SrI rUpa says, sadAnantEH... santi tAH, i.e., kfzRa is ever manifest in his beOty wiT his infinite pastimes in goloka. sometimes Te variant manifestation of Tose pastimes becomes visible on Te mundane plane. SrI hari, Te supreme lord, also manifests his pastimes of birT, etc., accompanied by all his paraPernalia. Te divine sportive potency fills Te hearts of his paraPernalia wiT appropriate spiritual sentiments in conformity wiT Te will of kfzRa. Tose pastimes Tat manifest Temselves on Te mundane plane, are his visible pastimes. all Tose very pastimes exist in Teir nonvisible form in goloka beyond Te ken of mundane knowledge. in his visible pastimes kfzRa sojourns in gokula, maTurA and dvArakA. Tose pastimes Tat are nonvisible in Tose Tree places, are visible in Teir spiritual sites of vfndAvana.
From Te conclusions just stated it is clear Tat Tere is no distinction between Te visible and nonvisible pastimes. Te apostle jIva gosvAmI in his commentary on Tis Sloka as well as in Te gloss of ujjvala-nIlamaRi and in kfzRa-sandarBa remarks Tat ""Te visible pastimes of kfzRa are Te creation of his cit (spiritual) potency. being in conjunction wiT Te reference to mundane function Tey exhibit certEn features whiC seem to be true by Te influence of Te limiting potency (mAyA); but Tese cannot exist in Te transcendental reality. Te destruction of demons, illicit paramourship, birT, etc., are examples of Tis peculiarity. Te gopIs are Te extensions of Te ecstatic energy of kfzRa, and so are exceptionally his own. how can Tere be illicit connection in Teir case? Te illicit mistress-ship of Te gopIs found in his visible pastime, is but Te mundane reflection of Te transcendental reality."" Te hidden meaning underlying Te words of SrI jIva gosvAmI, when it is made explicit, will leave no doubt in Te minds of Te readers. SrI jIva gosvAmI is our preaCer of transcendental truT. so he is always under Te influence of SrI rUpa and sanAtana. moreover in Te pastimes of kfzRa SrI jIva is one of Te maYjarIs. so he is conversant wiT all transcendental realities.
Tere are some who, being unable to understand Te drift of his statements, give meanings of Teir own invention and indulge in useless controversies. SrI rUpa and sanAtana say Tat Tere is no real and essential distinction between Te lIlAs visible and nonvisible, Te only distinction lies in Tis Tat one is manifest in Te mundane sPere whereas Te oTer is not so. in Te supermundane manifestation Tere is absolute purity in Te seer and Te seen. a particularly fortunate person when he is favored by kfzRa, can shake off worldly shackles and connections, enter Te transcendental region after attEning Te realized taste of Te varieties of rasa Tat is avElable during Te period of novitiate. only suC a person can have a view and taste of Te perfect and absolutely pure lIlA of goloka. suC receptive natures are rarely to be found. he, who exists in Te mundane sPere, can also realize Te taste of cid-rasa by Te grace of kfzRa by being enabled to attEn Te realized state of service. suC a person can have a view of Te pastimes of goloka manifested in Te mundane lIlA of gokula. Tere is certEnly a difference between Tese two classes of eligible seekers of Te truT. until one attEns Te perfectly transcendental stage he must be hampered by his lingering limitations, in his vision of Te pastimes of goloka. agEn, Te vision of Te transcendental reality varies according to Te degree of self-realization. Te vision of goloka must also vary accordingly.
it is only Tose fettered souls who are excessively addicted to worldliness Tat are devoid of Te devotional eye. of Tem some are enmeshed by Te variegatedness of Te deluding energy while oTers aspire after self-annihilation under Te influence of centrifugal knowledge. TouG Tey miGt have a view of Te mundanely manifested pastimes of Te supreme lord, Tey can have only a material conception of Tose visible pastimes, Tis conception being devoid of transcendental reality. hence Te realization of goloka appears in proportion to eligibility due to Te degree of one's self-realization. Te underlying principle is Tis, Tat, TouG gokula is as holy and free from dross as goloka, still it is manifested on Te mundane plane by Te influence of Te cit potency. yogamAyA. in visible and nonvisible matters of transcendental regions Tere is no impurity, contamination and imperfection inherent in Te world of limitation; only Tere is some difference in Te matter of realization in proportion to Te self-realization of Te seekers after Te absolute. impurity, unwholesomeness, foreign elements, illusion, nescience, unholiness, utter inadequacy, insignificance, grossness—Tese appertEn to Te eye, intellect, mind and ego stultified by Te material nature of conditioned souls; Tey have noTing to do wiT Te essential nature of transcendence. Te more one is free from Tese blots Te more is one capable of realizing Te unqualified absolute. Te truT who has been revealed by Te scriptures, is free from dross. but Te realizations of Te seekers of Te knowledge of Tese realities, are wiT or wiTout flaw in accordance wiT Te degree of Teir individual realization.
Tose sixty-four arts Tat have been enumerated above, do in reality exist unstintedly only in goloka. unwholesomeness, insignificance, grossness are found in Tose arts in accordance wiT Te degree of self-realization on Te part of aspirants after Te knowledge of Te absolute. according to SrIla rUpa and SrIla sanAtana all Tose pastimes, Tat have been visible in gokula, exist in all purity and free from all tinge of limitation in goloka. so transcendental Otocratic paramourship also exists in goloka in inconceivable purity, judged by Te same standard and reasoning. all manifestation by Te cit potency. yogamAyA, are pure. so, as Te above paramourship is Te creation of yogamAyA, it is necessarily free from all contamination, and appertEns to Te absolute reality.
let us pOse to consider what Te absolute reality is in himself. SrI rUpa gosvAmI says, pUrvokta-... sArataH. in regard to Tese Slokas SrIpAda jIva gosvAmI after mature deliberation has established Te transcendental paramourship as viBrama-vilAsa, someTing seemingly different from what it appears to be; suC are Te pastimes of birT, etc., accomplished by yogamAyA.
by Te explanation taTApi... vraja-vanitAnAm, SrIla jIva gosvAmI has expressed his profound implication. joyous pastimes by Te medium of seeming error, viBrama-vilAsa, as Te contrivance of yogamAyA, has also been admitted in Te concluding statements of rUpa and sanAtana. still, since SrIpAda jIva gosvAmI has established Te identity of goloka wiT gokula, it must be admitted Tat Tere is transcendental reality underlying all Te pastimes of gokula. a husband is one who binds oneself in wedlock wiT a girl, while a paramour is one who, in order to win anoTer's wife's love by means of love, crosses Te conventions of morality, by Te impulse of Te sentiment Tat regards her love as Te be-all and end-all of existence. in goloka Tere is no suC function at all as Tat of Te nuptial relationship. hence Tere is no husbanDood Caracterized by suC connection. on Te oTer hand since Te gopIs, who are self-supported real entities are not tied to anybody else in wedlock, Tey cannot also have Te state of concubinage. Tere can also be no separate entities in Te forms of svakIya (conjugal) and parakIya (adulterous) states. in Te visible pastimes on Te mundane plane Te function in Te form of Te nuptial relationship is found to exist. kfzRa is beyond Te scope of Tat function. hence Te sEd function of Te circle of all-love is contrived by yogamAyA. kfzRa tastes Te transcendental rasa akin to paramourship by overstepping Tat function. Tis pastime of going beyond Te pale of Te apparent moral function manifested by yogamAyA, is, however, also observable only on Te mundane plane by Te eye Tat is enwrapped by Te mundane covering; but Tere is really no suC levity in Te pastimes of kfzRa. Te rasa of paramourship is certEnly Te extracted essence of all Te rasas. if it be sEd Tat it does not exist in goloka, it would be hiGly deprecatory to goloka. it is not Te fact Tat Tere is no supremely wholesome tasting of rasa in Te supremely excellent realm of goloka. kfzRa, Te fountEnhead of all avatAras. tastes Te same in a distinct form in goloka and in anoTer distinct form in gokula. Terefore, in spite of Te seeming appearance, to Te mundane eye, of outstepping Te bounds of Te legitimate function by Te form of paramourship, Tere must be present Te truT of it in some form even in goloka. AtmArAmo 'py arIramat, Atmany avarudDa-sOrataH, reme vraja-sundarIBir yaTArBakaH pratibimba-viBramaH and oTer texts of Te scriptures go to show Tat self-deliGtedness is Te essential distinctive quality of kfzRa himself. kfzRa in his majestic cit realm cOses Te manifestation of his own cit potency as lakzmI and enjoys her as his own wedded consort. as Tis feeling of wedded consorTood preponderates Tere, rasa expands in a wholesome form only up to Te state of servanTood (dAsya-rasa). but in goloka he divides up his cit potency into Tousands of gopIs and eternally engages in amorous pastimes wiT Tem by forgetting Te sentiments of ownership. by Te sentiments of ownership Tere cannot be Te extreme inaccessibility of Te rasa. so Te gopIs have naturally, from eternity, Te innate sentiment of being oTers' wedded wives. kfzRa too in response to Tat sentiment, by assuming Te reciprocal sentiment of paramourship, performs Te rAsa and Te oTer amorous pastimes wiT Te Ed of Te flute, his favorite Cer ami. goloka is Te transcendental seat of eternally self-realized rasa, beyond limited conception. hence in goloka Tere is realization of Te sentimental assumption of Te rasa of paramourship.
agEn suC is Te nature of Te principle of Te majesty Tat in Te realm of vEkuRWa Tere is no rasa of parental affection towards Te source of all avatAras. but in goloka, Te seat of all superexcellent deliciousness, Tere is no more Tan Te original sentimental egoistic assumption of Te same rasa. Tere nanda and yaSodA are visibly present, but Tere is no occurrence of birT. For want of Te occurrence of birT Te assumed egoistic sentiment of parental affection of nanda and yaSodA has no foundation in Te actual existence of suC entities as faTer and moTer, but it is of Te nature of sentimental assumption on Teir parts, cf. jayati jana-nivAso devakI-janma-vAdaH, etc. For Te purpose of Te realization of Te rasa Te assumed egoistic sentiment is, however, eternal. in Te rasa of amorous love if Te corresponding egoistic sentiments of concubinage and paramourship be mere eternal assumptions Tere is noTing to blame in Tem and it also does not go agEnst Te scriptures. When Tose transcendental entities of goloka becomes manifest in vraja Ten Tose two egoistic sentiments become somewhat more palpable to Te mundane view in Te Penomenal world and Tere comes to be Tis muC difference only. in Te rasa of parental affection Te sentiments of nanda and yaSodA Tat Tey are parents becomes manifest in Te more tangible form in Te pastimes of birT etc., and in Te amorous rasa Te corresponding sentiments of concubinage in Te respective gopIs become manifest in Te forms of Teir marriages wiT aBimanyu, govarDana, etc. in reality Tere is no suC separate entity as husbanDood of Te gopIs eiTer in goloka or in gokula. hence Te SAstras declare Tat Tere is no sexual union of Te gopIs wiT Teir husbands. it is also for Te same reason Tat Te OTorized teaCer of Te principle of rasa, SrI rUpa, writes Tat in Te transcendental amorous rasa Te hero is of two different types, viz., Te wedded husband and Te paramour-patiS copapatiS ceti praBedAv iha viSrutAv iti. SrI jIva, in his commentary by his words patiH pura-vanitAnAṁ dvitIyo vraja-vanitAnAm, acknowledges Te eternal paramourship of kfzRa in goloka and gokula and Te husbanDood of kfzRa in vEkuRWa and dvArakA etc. in Te lord of goloka and Te lord of gokula Te Caracter of paramourship is found in its complete form. kfzRa's deliberate overstepping of his own quality of self-deliGtedness is cOsed by Te desire of union wiT anoTer's wedded wife. Te state of being anoTer's wedded wife is noTing but Te corresponding assumed sentiment on Te part of Te gopIs. in reality Tey have no husbands wiT independent and separate existence; still Teir very egoistic sentiment makes Tem have Te nature of Te wedded wives of oTers. so all Te Caracteristics, viz., Tat ""desire makes Te paramour overstep Te bounds of duty."" etc., are eternally present in Te seat of all ""deliciousness."" in vraja Tat very Ting reveals itself, to an extent, in a form more tangible to persons wiT mundane eyes.
so in goloka Tere is inconceivable distinction and nondistinction between Te rasas analogous to mundane concubineship and wifehood. it may be sEd wiT equal truT Tat Tere is no distinction in goloka between Te two as also Tat Tere is suC distinction. Te essence of paramourship is Te cessation of ownership and Te abeyance of ownership is Te enjoyment of his own cit potency in Te shape of abeyance of paramourship or enjoyment wiTout Te sanction of wedlock. Te conjunction of Te two exists Tere as one rasa accommodating boT varieties. in gokula it is really Te same wiT Te difference Tat it produces a different impression on observers belonging to Te mundane plane. in govinda, Te hero of goloka, Tere exist boT husbanDood and paramourship above all piety and impiety and free from all grossness. suC is also Te case wiT Te hero of gokula alTouG Tere is a distinction in realization cOsed by yogamAyA. if it be urged Tat what is manifested by yogamAyA is Te hiGest truT being Te creation of Te cit potency and Tat, Terefore, Te impression of paramourship is also really true, Te reply is Tat Tere may exist an impression of analogous sentimental egoism in Te tasting of rasa free from any offense becOse it is not wiTout a basis in truT. but Te unwholesome impression Tat is produced in Te mundane judgment is offensive and as suC cannot exist in Te pure cit realm. in fact SrIpAda jIva gosvAmI has come to Te true conclusion, and at Te same time Te finding of Te opposing party is also inconceivably true. it is Te vEn empirical wranglings about wedded wifehood and concubinage whiC is false and full of specious verbosity. he who goes TrouG Te commentaries of SrIpAda jIva gosvAmI and Tose of Te opposing party wiT an impartial judgment cannot mEntEn his attitude of protest engendered by any real doubt. What Te unalloyed devotee of Te supreme lord says is all true and is independent of any consideration of unwholesome pros and cons. Tere is, however, Te element of mystery in Teir verbal controversies. Tose, whose judgment is made of mundane stuff, being unable to enter into Te spirit of Te all-loving controversies among pure devotees, due to Teir own want of unalloyed devotion, are apt to impute to Te devotees Teir own defects of partisanship and opposing views. commenting on Te Sloka of rAsa-paYcADyAyI, gopInAṁ tat-patInAṁ ca, etc., what SrIpAda sanAtana gosvAmI has stated conclusively in his vEzRava-tozaRI has been accepted wiT reverence by Te true devotee SrIpAda viSvanATa cakravartI wiTout any protest.
Whenever any dispute arises regarding Te pure cognitive pastimes, suC as goloka, etc., we would do well to remember Te precious advice from Te holy lips of SrImAn mahApraBu and his associates, Te gosvAmIs, viz., Tat Te truT absolute is ever Caracterized by spiritual variegatedness Tat transcends Te variegatedness of mundane Penomena; but he is never featureless. Te divine rasa is lovely wiT Te variegatedness of Te fourfold distinction of viBAva, anuBAva, sAttvika and vyaBicAri and Te rasa is ever present in goloka and vEkuRWa. Te rasa of goloka manifests as vraja-rasa on Te mundane plane for Te benefit of Te devotees by Te power of yogamAyA. Whatever is observable in gokula-rasa should be visible in goloka-rasa, in a clearly explicit form. hence Te distinction of paramourship and concubinage, Te variegatedness of Te respective rasas of all different persons, Te soil, water, river, hill, portico, bower, cows, etc., all Te features of gokula exist in goloka, disposed in an appropriate manner. Tere is only Tis peculiarity Tat Te mundane conceptions of human beings possessed of material judgment, regarding Tose transcendental entities, do not exist Tere. Te conception of goloka manifests itself differently in proportion to Te degree of realization of Te various pastimes of vraja and it is very difficult to lay down any definite criterion as to whiC portions are mundane and whiC are uncontaminated. Te more Te eye of devotion is tinged wiT Te salve of love, Te more will Te transcendental concept gradually manifest itself. so Tere is no need of furTer hypoTetical speculation whiC does not improve one's spiritual appreciation, as Te substantive knowledge of goloka is an inconceivable entity. to try to pursue Te inconceivable by Te conceptual process is like pounding Te empty husk of grEn, whiC is sure to have a fruitless ending. it is, Terefore, one's bounden duty. by refrEning from Te endeavor to know, to try to gEn Te experience of Te transcendental by Te practice of pure devotion. any course, Te adoption of whiC tends to produce Te impression of featurelessness, must be shunned by all means. unalloyed parakIya-rasa free from all mundane conception is a most rare attEnment. it is Tis whiC has been described in Te narrative of Te pastimes of gokula. Tose devotees, who follow Te dictate of Teir pure spontaneous love, should base Teir devotional endeavors on Tat narrative. Tey will attEn to Te more wholesome fundamental principle on reaCing Te stage of realization. Te devotional activities Caracterized by illicit amour, as practiced by worldly-minded conditioned souls, are forbidden mundane impiety. Te heart of our apostle SrIpAda jIva gosvAmI was very muC moved by suC practices and induced him to give us his conclusive statements on Te subject. it is Te duty of a pure vEzRava to accept Te real spirit of his statements. it is a great offense to disrespect Te AcArya and to seek to establish a different doctrine in opposition to him.

Te function Caracterized by unalloyed devotion is Te real function of all individual souls (jIvas). all oTer varieties of function are activities of Te external cases. Tese exoteric and esoteric Darmas (functions) are manifold, e.g., nondifferential knowledge of Te brahman Eming at extinction of individuality. Te azwANga-yoga-Darma having as its goal attEnment of Te state of exclusive existence (kEvalya), aTeistical fruitive ritualism Eming at material enjoyment, jYAna-yoga-Darma seeking to combine knowledge wiT fruitive activity and Te practice of Te function of barren asceticism. getting rid of all Tese, serve me by pure devotion rooted in fET. exclusive fET in me is trust. FET in Te form of trust by Te process of gradual purification tends to become a constant engagement (nizWA), an object of liking (ruci), of attaCment (Asakti) and a real sentiment (BAva). Te more transparent Te fET, Te greater Te degree of realization. if you ask-how will Te preservation and conduct of worldly affErs be feasible if one is continuously engaged in Te endeavor for Te realization of Bakti? What also will be Te nature of Te endeavor for Te realization of Bakti when Te body will perish consequent on Te cessation of Te function of Te body and of society?
in order to strike at Te root of Tis misgiving Te supreme lord says, ""Tis world subsists by Te constant performance of certEn activities. Fill all Tese activities wiT meditation of me. Tis will destroy Te quality Tat makes Tose activities appear as acts done by you. Tey will Ten be of Te nature of my service (Bakti).
""mankind live by Te Treefold activities of body, mind and society. eating, seating, walking, resting, sleeping, cleansing Te body. covering Te body. etc., are Te various bodily activities; Tinking, recollecting, retEning an impression, becoming aware of an entity. feeling pleasure and pEn, etc., are Te mental feats; marrying, practicing reciprocal relationship between Te king and subject, practicing broTerhood, attending at sacrificial meetings, offering oblations, digging wells, tanks, etc., for Te benefit of Te people, mEntEning one's relations, practicing hospitality. observing proper civic conduct, showing due respect to oTers are Te various social activities. When Tese acts are performed for one's selfish enjoyment, Tey are called karma-kARqa; when Te desire for attEnment of freedom from activity by knowledge underlies Tese actions, Tey are termed jYAna-yoga or karma-yoga. and when Tese activities are managed to be performed in Tis way Tat is conducive to our endeavor for attEnment of Bakti Tey are called jYAna-Bakta-yoga, i.e., Te subsidiary devotional practices. but only Tose activities Tat are Caracterized by Te principle of pure worship are called Bakti proper. my meditation is practiced in every act when Bakti proper is practiced in due time while performing Te subsidiary devotional activities in one's intercourse wiT Te ungodly people of Tis world. in suC position, a jIva does not become apaTetic to goDead even by performing Tose worldly activities. Tis constitutes Te practice of looking inwards, i.e., turning towards one's real self, vide ISopanizad-
ISAvAsyam idaṁ sarvaṁyat kiYca jagatyAṁ jagattena tyaktena BuYjITAmA gfDaH kasya svid Danam
[ISo mantra 1]
Te commentator says in regards to Tis, tena ISa-tyaktena visfzwena. Te real significance being Tat if whatever is accepted be received as favor vouCsafed by Te supreme lord, Te worldly activity will cease to be suC and will turn into service of goDead (Bakti). so ISAvAsya says kurvann eveha karmARi... karma lipyate nare.
if Te worldly acts are performed in Te above manner one does not get entangled in karma even in hundreds of years of worldly life. Te meaning of Tese two mantras from Te jYAna point of view is renouncement of Te fruits of one's worldly actions; but from Te Bakti point of view Tey mean Te attEnment of kfzRa's favor (prasAdam) by Teir transfer to his account. in Tis meTod, whiC is Te paT of arcana, you should do your duties of Te world by Te meditation of worshiping goDead Tereby. brahmA Cerishes Te desire for creation in his heart. if Tat creative desire is practiced by conjoining Te same wiT Te meditation of obeying Terein Te command of Te supreme lord, Ten it will be a subsidiary spiritual function (gORa-Darma) being helpful for Te growT of Te disposition for Te service of Te divinity by reason of its Caracteristic of seeking Te protection of goDead. it was certEnly proper to instruct brahmA in Tis manner. Tere is no occasion for suC instruction in Te case of a jIva in whom Te spontaneous aversion for entities oTer Tan kfzRa manifests itself on his attEnment of Te substantive entity of spiritual devotion (BAva).
