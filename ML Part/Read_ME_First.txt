There are 4 Vector-Based Approaches Used in the ML Part:
BM25
Count Vectorization
Embedding Based
TF/IDF

1)ctp file contains recommendation from both Countvec and tfidf approach
2)BM25 and embedding based has 2 different files
3)List_copy is used for making vectors of all shlokas.
4)AllMatch has all recommendation from all approaches (only recommendations included)
5)MatchU is elaborative document having all recommendations.
6)with10 contains first 10 recommendation of countvec and tfidf approach
